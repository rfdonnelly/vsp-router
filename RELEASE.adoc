= Release Process

This project uses https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/[cargo-dist] and https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release[cargo-release] to simplify cutting new releases.

== Update the Changelog

 vim CHANGELOG.md
 git add CHANGELOG
 git commit
 git push

== Create a Release

 cargo release <version>

E.g.

 cargo release 1.0.1

== Sit Back and Relax

Sit back and relax while `cargo-dist` automatically creates a GitHub Release and releases binaries for each platform.
