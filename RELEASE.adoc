= Release Process

This project uses https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/[cargo-dist] and https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release[cargo-release] to simplify cutting new releases.

== Update the Changelog

 vim CHANGELOG.md
 git add CHANGELOG.md
 git commit
 git push

== Dryrun the Release

 cargo dist build
 cargo dist plan
 cargo release <version>

E.g.

 cargo release 1.0.1

== Execute the Release

 cargo release <version> --execute

E.g.

 cargo release 1.0.1 --execute

This will:

* Update version in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` and commit them
* Publish the release to crates.io
* Creates a tag and pushes it

Pushing the tag then kicks off cargo-dist which:

* Builds release artifacts
* Creates a GitHub Release

== Sit Back and Relax

Sit back and relax while `cargo-dist` automatically creates a GitHub Release and releases binaries for each platform.
